"OpenRAVE provides an environment for testing, developing, and deploying "
"motion planning algorithms in real-world robotics applications. The main "
"focus is on simulation and analysis of kinematic and geometric information "
"related to motion planning. OpenRAVE's stand-alone nature allows is to be "
"easily integrated into existing robotics systems. It provides many command "
"line tools to work with robots and planners, and the run-time core is small "
"enough to be used inside controllers and bigger frameworks. An important "
"target application is industrial robotics automation."
