"Internal matrices are in column-order, row-major format. If this is "
"confusing, check out this guide. This means affine matrix representation is "
"using the standard math way. All matrices are serialized in column-major "
"format, this is to make it simpler for Octave/Matlab to convert between "
"matrices. Note that python expects row-major matrices, which require "
"transposition when passed around the two interfaces."
