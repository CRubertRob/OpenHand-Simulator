"OpenRAVE includes a seamless integration of simulation, visualization, "
"planning, scripting and control. The plugin architecture allows users to "
"easily write custom controllers or extend functionality. Using OpenRAVE "
"plugins, any planning algorithm, robot control, or sensing-based subsystem "
"can be distributed and dynamically loaded at run-time; this distributed "
"nature frees developers from struggling with monolithic code-bases. Users of "
"OpenRAVE can concentrate on the development of planning and scripting "
"aspects of a problem without having to explicitly manage the details of "
"robot kinematics and dynamics, collision detection, world updates, and robot "
"control. OpenRAVE provides a powerful :ref:`Python API <package-openravepy>` "
"for scripting demos, which makes it simple to control and monitor the demo "
"and environment state. There are also interfaces for Octave and Matlab."

"OpenRAVE has been used for planning on many real robotics systems. It's "
"architcture makes it possible for planning-enabled robots to work "
"consistently in a continuously changing and unpredictable environment. Many "
"new layer of functionality have been developed that go beyond the basic "
"kinematics, collision detection, and graphics interface requirements of "
"classic robotics libraries. It provides a set of interfaces that let users "
"modify existing functions and expand OpenRAVE-enabled modules without having "
"to recompile OpenRAVE or deal with messy monolithic code-bases."
