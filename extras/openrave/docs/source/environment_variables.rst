Environment Variables
=====================

.. envvar:: OPENRAVE_DATA

  Search paths/URLs for loading robot/environment/model files. The robots and scenes installed with OpenRAVE will be always accessible, so there's no need to specify them again.

  Use ':' to separate each directory (';' for Windows).

.. envvar:: OPENRAVE_DATABASE

  Search paths for loading database files created by the openrave database system. Databases are used to store useful information/statistics about the robot, target object, and sensors that take a long time to pre-compute or rely on real-world data. When writing, the first valid directory is used. If environment variable is not set, then $OPENRAVE_HOME is used.

  Use ':' to separate each directory (';' for Windows). 

.. envvar:: OPENRAVE_HOME

  Used to set the directory of the openrave local cache and log files. The default directory is ``$HOME/.openrave``.

.. envvar:: OPENRAVE_PLUGINS

  At startup, OpenRAVE searches for every shared object/dll plugin in these directories and loads them. The default plugins are always loaded, so there is no need to include them again.

  Use ':' to separate each directory (';' for Windows). 

.. envvar:: OPENRAVE_DEFAULT_VIEWER

  At program startup, OpenRAVE will try to load this viewer if it exists, otherwise will default to the next best valid viewer.

.. envvar:: OPENRAVE_DEFAULT_COLLISIONCHECKER

  At program startup, OpenRAVE will try to load this collision checker if it exists, otherwise will default to the next best valid viewer.
