OpenRAVE Release Information
=====================================

Every release comes with:

* **X-src.tar.bz2** - Source code. Windows users would need the msvc_files.tgz from Subversion to use it.

* **X-win32-vcX-setup.exe** - Windows Installers compiled for VS2008 (vc90) and VS2010 (vc100). 

**Windows 7 x64 Users**: If programs crash using the VS2010 package, please try VS2008 package.

For x.y.z releases, official releases are when **y** and **z** are both even numbers.

Files are generated and uploaded using the scripts in the **release** source folder. See `Developer's Guide <http://openrave.org/en/main/devel/releases.html>`_ for more information.

latest_stable
