**** I. Package Contents ****

ParabolicRamp.h/cpp
  - Header and definition file for time-optimal, acceleration-bounded
    trajectories in 1 and N dimensions.
DynamicPath.h/cpp
  - Header and definition file for smoothing paths using a shortcut
    method.
Timer.h/cpp
  - A timer, used in DynamicPath::OnlineShortcut.  These files and
    the code for OnlineShortcut can be safely removed if online
    shortcutting is not used in your program.
Math.h
  - Definitions of basic math subroutines.
doxygen.conf
  - Configuration file for the automatic documentation tool doxygen.


**** II. Usage ****

Add the files *.h and *.cpp to your project and compile with a C++
compiler.  Optionally, documentation can be generated using the
doxygen tool by running the command 'doxygen doxygen.conf' in this
directory.

Real numbers are written as 'Real's, which is typedef'ed as double by
default.  Multidimensional vectors are represented as 'Vector's which
are typedef'ed as vector<Real>.

** II.A. Basic Smoothing **

For a path given as a sequence of milestones (such as a path output
by a probablistic roadmap planner), the basic smoothing algorithm is
invoked as follows.

  vector<Vector> path;        //the sequence of milestones
  Vector vmax,amax;           //velocity and acceleration bounds, respectively
  MyFeasibilityChecker feas;  //a configuration feasibility checker, subclassed from FeasibilityCheckerBase
  RampFeasibilityChecker checker(&feas,tol);
  int numIters=1000;          //some number of shortcutting iterations
  Real tol=1e-4;              //if a point is feasible, any point within tol is considered acceptable
  //TODO: compute milestones, velocity and acceleration bounds

  DynamicPath traj;
  traj.Init(vmax,amax);
  traj.SetMilestones(path);   //now the trajectory starts and stops at every milestone
  printf("Initial path duration: %g\n",traj.GetTotalTime());
  int res=traj.Shortcut(numIters,checker);
  printf("After shortcutting: %d shortcuts taken, duration %g\n",traj.GetTotalTime());

** II.B. Exact Collision Checking **

To use exact trajectory collision checking, you must implement
DistanceCheckerBase to return a lower bound on the L-infinity distance
between a configuration and the obstacle boundary (in C-space).
Then, pass the feasibility checker and distance checker to the overloaded
RampFeasibilityChecker constructor.  (For this variant, the
FeasibilityCheckerBase::SegmentFeasible method does not need to
be implemented. )

** II.C. Online Smoothing **

A faster way of smoothing is to interleave trajectory smoothing with
execution.  Omitting synchronization code, the pseudocode for doing
so is as follows:

Input:
  traj, a DynamicPath to be executed and smoothed
  padTime, a constant ~= a bound on the time it takes to perform one shortcut
  A timer function Time()

Execution thread:
  x = traj.Evaluate(Time())
  Move toward configuration x

Smoothing thread:
  while (Time() < traj.GetTotalTime()) 
    t1 = Rand(Time()+padTime,traj.GetTotalTime())
    t2 = Rand(Time()+padTime,traj.GetTotalTime())
    DynamicPath temp = traj
    temp.TryShortcut(t1,t2)
    // the shortcut may have taken too long, if so, throw it out
    if (Time() > t1)
      continue
    else
      traj = temp

For slightly better performance, the sampling strategy for picking points
along the trajectory can be tuned.  For example, biasing t1 to more heavily
sample points near the current execution time seems to be effective.  See
DynamicPath::OnlineShortcut for more information.
